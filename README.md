ML-APT overview. We developed a framework for deciphering the details of multi-type CSROs in H/MEAs, which combines ML, APT experiments/simulations, Monte-Carlo simulations, and electrical measurements. (A) First, a series of site-specific APT experiments are performed to collect the desired data, which are voxelized into millions of 1-nm cubes that are transformed into z-SDMs. (B) Then, a CSRO recognition model is obtained by utilising the simulated CSRO pattern bank to train a neural network. Its reliability is verified by a large-scale APT simulation. (C) Third, the preprocessed experimental z-SDMs are fed into the CSRO recognition model to obtain the 3D CSRO distribution. The details of multiple-CSROs are revealed, supported by atomistic simulations. (D) Finally, the composition/processing-CSRO-electrical resistivity relationships are built.
